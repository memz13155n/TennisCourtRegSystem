The coach of Greater Portmore table tennis club needs a sufficient system to monitor its players 
as well as money spent and earned at the club. Money is often lost because there is not a 
sufficient way to track it. The old paper based system is not reliable. On multiple occasions, 
heavy rains caused flooding destroying the paper based records as well as rodents and other 
creatures would often destroy old records stored in the archive. It also proves difficult to track 
each individual player’s progress as there are a lot of players and coaches can sometimes forget 
and get confused.
The system will be designed to help keep track off the payments made to the club as well as the 
progress made by each individual player. Players information such as player names, ID number, 
gender, money paid, will be inputted to the system by the secretary. The system will also allow 
the main coach to input coaches notes, which will be notes made for specific players that 
contains information about the coach’s thoughts about the specific players. The main coach will 
also have the option to input the number of tournaments won by each player as well as the 
players rank. The assistant coach will only have the option to input to view the notes and the 
progress report for each player system. The fitness coach will also have the option to input 
various exercises specific for each player as well as any pre-existing medical conditions that any 
player may have. The program will be a menu driven interface and will have options for the all 
users to choose the function he wants the program to perform.
